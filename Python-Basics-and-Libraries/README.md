# Python Basics and Libraries - Internship Learning

This repository contains my learning work during my internship focusing on Python Basics and Libraries.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Python syntax, data structures, and functions
- **Pandas** - Data handling and manipulation
- **NumPy** - Array operations and numerical computing
- **Flask** - Building web applications and APIs

## 🎯 Learning Resources

- freeCodeCamp Python Tutorial
- Pandas Official Quickstart
- Flask Official Documentation

## 📝 Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Python Functions
**File:** `Task1.py`

Created 3 functions that pass values to each other and display results:
- `func1()` - Receives a number and multiplies it by 2
- `func2()` - Receives the result and adds 10
- `func3()` - Calculates the factorial of the result

### Task 2: NumPy Operations
**File:** `Task2.py`

Performed various NumPy operations on both numeric and string arrays:
- **Numeric Operations:** sum, mean, median, max, min
- **Array Operations:** split, append, insert, concatenate, sort
- Worked with both number arrays and string arrays

### Task 3: Pandas Data Cleaning
**File:** `Task3.py`

Built a data processing script that:
- Loads CSV files using Pandas
- Identifies missing values
- Cleans data by filling missing values (mean for numeric, mode for non-numeric)
- Exports a summary of the cleaned data

### Task 4: Flask Hello World
**File:** `Task4.py`

Created a simple Flask web application featuring:
- A "Hello World" page
- An HTML form for user input
- Dynamic greeting based on form submission

### Task 5: Flask User Greeting
**File:** `Task5.py`

Built an interactive Flask form that:
- Accepts a user's name
- Greets the user with a personalized message
- Combines HTML frontend with Python backend

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install numpy pandas flask
```
